# CS249 - Project 8
## ASSIGNMENT OBJECTIVES

- Students will develop a Java class that manages class data from stated specifications

- Students will correctly and effectively apply given programming standard specifications

- Students will correctly and effectively develop code that could support a Javadoc user document out of their own Java source code

- Students will demonstrate the ability to implement algorithms necessary to implement all of the stated specifications

- Students will demonstrate competence with managing a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java

- Students will demonstrate analytic and diagnostic competence with testing and verifying all components of the given assignment

## ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

- This project will exercise your abilities with self-balancing trees as a data structure

## ASSIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS

- You are to develop a Java Class that holds character data, and stores that data in a self-balancing BST

- the BST uses the Adelson-Velsky and Landis (AVL) strategy

- you are given the class with some of the methods to be implemented. The class also has display tools that show the tree as it is built; this can be used as a diagnostic tool as well as a final evaluation tool

- Document your code so that it can be processed by the Javadoc system to generate documentation as much like the original documentation as possible

- The wording does not have to be exactly the same but the method names and actions must be the same, and the descriptions must be semantically correct

- Upload only the AVL_TreeClass.java file; do not upload any other files
