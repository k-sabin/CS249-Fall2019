# CS249-Project3
CS249 Project 3 Fall 2019

## ASSIGNMENT OBJECTIVES

- Students will review the development of a basic data type that incorporates the use of array data management

- Students will review use of Java arrays, and practice basic algorithmic activities with arrays, including basic sorting strategies

- Students will review the pass-by-copy practice of Java, along with managing potential aliasing issues in method development

- Students will practice development, implementation, and usage of supporting/utility methods

- Students will generate classes that manage data in the form of a one dimensional array

- Students will practice implementing methods in such a way that code is rarely, if ever, repeated by implementing supporting or utility methods in their development activities

- Students will demonstrate analytic and diagnostic competence with testing and verifying all components of the given assignment

## ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

- Students will (again) develop a simple class that manages the addition, search, and remove operations for a given data type

- Students will develop two sorting strategies using a one dimensional array of characters, within the given class

- Students will sort StudentClass data with the merge sort and quick sort


## ASSIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS

- Students must (again) develop the code required to manage addition, searching, and removing data items

- Students must develop the code required to implement each of the two given strategies

- Students must develop and/or refine other supporting methods as specified (below) to manage the sorting operations

- Students will also document all classes and methods using the Javadoc commenting process; comments are not required to be exactly the same as found in the supporting document (below) but they should be semantically equivalent

- Students will upload the LogN_RegistrarClass.java file to this assignment; any other uploaded files will result in a reduction of the project grade, and in some cases, may cause a complete loss of credit (e.g., uploading *.class, or other unusable files)
