# CS249 - Project 6
## ASSIGNMENT OBJECTIVES

- Students will review the development of a basic data type that incorporates the use of linked list data management

- Students will review use of Java linked data, and apply their knowledge to a linked list system

- Students will review the pass-by-copy practice of Java, along with managing potential aliasing issues in method development

- Students will practice development, implementation, and usage of supporting/utility methods

- Students will generate classes that manage data in the form of a linked list

- Students will practice implementing methods in such a way that code is rarely, if ever, repeated by implementing supporting or utility methods in their development activities

- Students will demonstrate analytic and diagnostic competence with testing and verifying all components of the given assignment

## ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

- Students will develop a basic linked list utility class, inherit that class to an Stack class ("isa" relationship), and then use the class as a data structure for a Stack class ("hasa" relationship)

## ASSIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS

- Students must develop the code necessary to create an array utility class that uses a linked list as its engine

- Students must develop the code necessary to inherit the array utility class to create an stack class, using one other member field

- Students must develop the code necessary use the array utility class as a data structure to create an iterator class, using no other member fields

- Students will also document all classes and methods using the Javadoc commenting process; comments are not required to be exactly the same as found in the supporting document (below) but they must be semantically equivalent

- Students will upload the completed StudentLinkedListClass.java, StudentLinkedIteratorClass.java, and StudentLinkedStackClass.java to this assignment; any other uploaded files will result in a reduction of the project grade, and in some cases, may cause a complete loss of credit (e.g., uploading *.class, or other unusable files)

### Other requirements:

o students must not extend any classes with java.lang.object; this is implicitly conducted

o students must not prepend any classes with StudentLinkedListClass; this is implicitly conducted

### Other Constraints:

- The General Usage Rubric will be applied to all code developed by the students; verify that your code does not incur any credit reduction due to these standards

- All methods must be placed in the class file in alphabetical order so methods can be found by graders; methods not found will not be graded

- Students are given a maximum of three attempts to upload their work to this BBLearn assignment page
