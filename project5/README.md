# CS249 - Project 5

## ASSIGNMENT OBJECTIVES

- Students will review the development of a basic data type that incorporates the use of array data management

- Students will review use of Java arrays, and practice basic algorithmic activities with arrays

- Students will review the pass-by-copy practice of Java, along with managing potential aliasing issues in method development

- Students will practice development, implementation, and usage of supporting/utility methods

- Students will generate classes that manage data in the form of a one dimensional array

- Students will practice implementing methods in such a way that code is rarely, if ever, repeated by implementing supporting or utility methods in their development activities

- Students will distinguish between "isa" and "hasa" relationships by inheriting an ADT for one class and using the same ADT for another class

- Students will demonstrate analytic and diagnostic competence with testing and verifying all components of the given assignment

## ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

- Students will develop a basic array utility class, inherit that class to a Queue class ("isa" relationship), and then use the class as a data structure for an Iterator class ("hasa" relationship)


## ASSIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS

- Students must develop the code necessary to create an array utility class. The class is made to look like an array that starts with index 1 and ends with index size although in the class itself the array must start at index 0
- Students must develop the code necessary to inherit the array utility class to create a queue class, using no other member fields
- Students must develop the code necessary use the array utility class as a data structure used by an iterator class, using one other member field
- Students will also document all classes and methods using the Javadoc commenting process; comments are not required to be exactly the same as found in the supporting document (below) but they should be semantically equivalent
- Students will upload the completed StudentListClass.java, StudentIteratorClass.java, and StudentQueueClass.java to this assignment; any other uploaded files will result in a reduction of the project grade, and in some cases, may cause a complete loss of credit (e.g., uploading *.class, or other unusable files)

### Other requirements:
- students must not extend any classes with java.lang.object; this is implicitly conducted

### Other Constraints:

- The General Usage Rubric will be applied to all code developed by the students; verify that your code does not incur any credit reduction due to these standards

 - All methods must be placed in the class file in alphabetical order so methods can be found by graders; methods not found will not be graded

 - Students are given a maximum of three attempts to upload their work to this BBLearn assignment page
