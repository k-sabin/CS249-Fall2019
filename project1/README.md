# cs249-project1
Project 1 from CS249 Fall 2019


ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

- Students will develop an encryption system that diagonally places data starting in the lower right corner of a two-dimensional array

- Students will encrypt and download encrypted strings, and upload and decrypt encrypted strings using the algorithm specified

ASSIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS


- Students must develop the code required to create a square two-dimensional array just large enough to store a given string in encrypted 
form using the given encryption algorithm. The character used after the end of the encrypted string is the ASCII delete key, 
set as final UNPRINTABLE_CHAR_VALUE. After this value is stored, the encryption process fills the remaining elements with random values

- Students must develop the code to decrypt a given square two-dimensional array and using the given encryption algorithm

- Students must develop other supporting methods as specified (below) to manage the encryption operations

- Students will also document all classes and methods using the Javadoc commenting process; comments are not required to be exactly 
the same as found in the supporting document (below) but they should be semantically equivalent

- Students will upload the EncryptionClass.java file to this assignment; any other uploaded files will result in a reduction of the 
project grade, and in some cases, may cause a complete loss of credit (e.g., uploading *.class, or other unusable files)
