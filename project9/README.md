# CS249 - Project 9

## ASSIGNMENT OBJECTIVES

- Students will review use of Java array data, and apply their knowledge to a max heap data structure

- Students will review the pass-by-copy practice of Java, along with managing potential aliasing issues in method development

- Students will practice development, implementation, and usage of supporting/utility methods

- Students will generate a class that manages data in the form of a max heap

- Students will practice implementing methods in such a way that code is rarely, if ever, repeated by implementing supporting or utility methods in their development activities

## ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

- Students will develop a max heap called ArrayHeapClass for managing unique integers

## ASSIGNMENT SPECIFICATIONS

- Students will implement all of the methods for the ArrayHeapClass using specifications from the Javadocs link provided below.

- Students will also document all classes and methods using the Javadoc commenting process; comments are not required to be exactly the same as found in the supporting document (below) but they must be semantically equivalent

- Students will upload the completed ArrayHeapClass.java to this assignment; any other uploaded files will result in a reduction of the project grade, and in some cases, may cause a complete loss of credit (e.g., uploading *.class, or other unusable files)

### Other requirements:

- students must not extend any classes with java.lang.object; this is implicitly conducted

### Other Constraints:

- The General Usage Rubric will be applied to all code developed by the students; verify that your code does not incur any credit reduction due to these standards

- All methods must be placed in the class file in alphabetical order so methods can be found by graders; methods not found will not be graded

- Students are given a maximum of three attempts to upload their work to this BBLearn assignment page
